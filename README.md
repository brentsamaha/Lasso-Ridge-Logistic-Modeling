# Zestimate-Logistic-Modeling

For this assignment, we were tested on our skills and knowledge regarding Lasso, Ridge, and Logistic regression. Part one of the assignment dealt with a dataset from Zillow comprised of many variables of property features and a logerror. The logerror is the difference between Zillow's "Zestimate" and the actual sell price of the property. In the assignment, I cleaned through the data set, did some feature engineering, and created a Lasso and Ridge model. After creating the models, I used the property variables to predict what the "Zestimate" would be and measured model metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R^2. I then did feature engineering to help the model run better, ie., create a model that would give a smaller logerror, which would equate to Zillow more closely guessing a property's value.

For the second part of the assignment, I performed a Logisitc regression on a dataset comprised of mainly categorical variables. By creating a logistic model using only the interger variables given, I was able to see the increase in model performance after feature engineering through metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, and AUC. After completing feature engineering, primarily one-hot-encoding, model performance was enhanced greatly as the model had additional variables to train on.
